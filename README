Capston Project: 

This is a capston project completed as part of my Hyperion Bootcamp 

For this task, assume that you have been approached by a small financial company and asked to create a program 
that allows the user to access two different financial calculators: an investment calculator and a home loan 
repayment calculator.

The project was created in python.
