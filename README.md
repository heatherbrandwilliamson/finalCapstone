Capstone Project: 

This is a capston project completed as part of my Hyperion Bootcamp 

THE TASK AT HAND

Let us assume that you work for a Nike warehouse. As store manager you are responsible for managing the warehouse, and more importantly, performing stock taking. To optimise your delivery time and for improved organisation, you have decided to use your Python knowledge to get an overview of what each stock-taking session entailed.

Nike warehouses store the following information for each stock-taking list: 
● Country
● Code
● Product 
● Cost
● Quantity 
● Value

Other store managers (in other regions) would like to be able to use your program to do the following:

● Search products by code.
● Determine the product with the lowest quantity and restock it.
● Determine the product with the highest quantity.
● Calculate the total value of each stock item. The total value is calculated by
multiplying the cost by the quantity for each item entered into the system.


Project Installation: The project can be run using any IDE capable of running Python files.
